#Bing Chrome Search Automation
This Python project uses Selenium WebDriver to automate Bing searches with random search terms. The project is designed to run Chrome in a specified user profile and perform 45 automated searches on Bing, simulating user interaction.

Features
Performs 45 random searches on Bing.
Uses Selenium WebDriver to automate Chrome browser.
Searches for a random search term from a predefined list.
Optionally uses a specific Chrome User Profile for maintaining session data.
Waits for 2-5 seconds between searches to mimic real user behavior.
Requirements
Python 3.x
You can download it from here.

Selenium WebDriver
Install via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
Chrome WebDriver
Download the compatible version of chromedriver from here and ensure it is in your system's PATH or specify the path in the script.

Google Chrome
Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your machine.

Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bing-chrome-search.git
cd bing-chrome-search
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that the ChromeDriver is compatible with your Chrome version and placed correctly.

Update the profile path in the script (bing_chrome_search.py):

python
Copy code
profile_path = r"C:\Users\sanje\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python bing_chrome_search.py
How It Works
The script opens the Bing search engine in Chrome.
It then picks 45 random search terms from a predefined list and performs searches one by one.
After each search, the script waits for a random time (between 2-5 seconds) to simulate human-like browsing behavior.
The search terms include topics like Python, AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and more.
Example Search Terms
The script picks random search terms from the following list:

python programming:
AI technology
web development
cloud computing
data science
machine learning
artificial intelligence
JavaScript
database management
software engineering
AWS tutorial
data structures
Notes
If you're using a custom Chrome user profile, make sure that no Chrome processes are running before executing the script. If necessary, remove any leftover DevToolsActivePort files in your user data directory.
The script simulates searches using an existing Chrome user profile, which can help preserve your session state across different runs.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter the SessionNotCreatedException error, make sure all Chrome processes are closed and no instance of Chrome is using the profile.
Ensure that your Chrome WebDriver version matches your installed Chrome version.
